IAM Product Capabilities (Feature Definition)
The following IAM capabilities were defined directly from the M&T Bank Cybersecurity Product Owner (IAM) job description and translated into product-owned features that can be delivered and measured.

Capability 1 — Identity Lifecycle Management (Joiner / Mover / Leaver)
Description:** Standardizes Joiner, Mover, and Leaver processes to ensure access is provisioned, modified, and revoked in alignment with security policy and business requirements.
Business Value:** Reduces onboarding delays, prevents access creep, and ensures timely deprovisioning.
Risk Addressed:** Orphaned accounts, excessive privilege, delayed offboarding, audit gaps.

Capability 2 — Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
Description:** Defines and enforces access based on job function using group-based role assignment to maintain least privilege and consistent access control.
Business Value:** Scales access management, reduces manual errors, and improves consistency across applications.
Risk Addressed:** Privilege escalation, inconsistent access grants, role ambiguity.

Capability 3 — Authentication & MFA User Experience
Description:** Ensures users authenticate with approved authentication factors and follow consistent registration steps to reduce account compromise.
Business Value:** Improves identity security posture while maintaining usability and reducing login friction.
Risk Addressed:** Credential theft, account takeover, weak authentication methods.

Capability 4 — Deprovisioning & Risk Reduction
Description:** Ensures access is removed promptly when employment status changes to reduce residual risk and unauthorized access.
Business Value:** Reduces insider risk, ensures offboarding completeness, and prevents dormant accounts from persisting.
Risk Addressed:** Dormant accounts, lingering access, insider threat exposure.

Capability 5 — Audit, Evidence & Compliance Readiness
Description:** Maintains audit-ready evidence of access decisions, lifecycle actions, and control enforcement through structured documentation.
Business Value:** Speeds up audit response, improves traceability, and strengthens accountability.
Risk Addressed:** Compliance gaps, inability to prove controls, audit findings.

Capability 6 — IAM Platform Constraints & Compensating Controls
Description:** Identifies licensing/tooling constraints and defines compensating controls and roadmap enhancements to close control gaps.
Business Value:** Provides transparency, supports prioritization, and enables realistic delivery planning.
Risk Addressed:** Hidden control gaps, unmanaged technical debt, false assurance.
These capabilities form the foundation of the IAM product backlog and will be prioritized based on risk reduction, business impact, and delivery feasibility in an Entra ID Free environment.
